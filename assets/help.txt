MAIN COMMANDS
    scan v  (-f fileName)
    print v (-f fileName)
    gem v
    transpose v
    evaluate v
    inverse v
    rank v
    determinant v
    delete v
where v = variable name (1 character only)
    clear (calls bash's clear)
-----------------------------
COMMANDS THAT SET VARIABLES
    v = ... (maths expression)
    v1 = merge v2 v3
    v1 = split v2 (m,n) [c_m, c_n] where m x n = size of splitted matrix;
                                     c_m, c_n = coordinates from where to splitted
    v1 = transpose v2
    v1 = inverse v2
-----------------------------
MATRIX SYNTAX
    matrix = [a b c ... ; m n k ... ; ... ; ... ]
        where a,b,c are numbers with floating point (kept as floats)
    '[' and ']' are necessary
    the only delimeter between rows is ';'
    if number of columns in different rows does not match, matrix won't be read
-----------------------------
MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS    
    this calculator can evaluate basic matrix operations such as 
    matrix + matrix, matrix * matrix , matrix - matrix,
    number * matrix, number * number, number - number 
    it also supports parenthesis and variables
    meaning that expressions with variables can be evaluated differently 
    depending on current value of variable in memory
-----------------------------
VARIABLES
    variables can be both number and matrix
-----------------------------
EXIT
    to exit press ':q!'
    nah, it's just 'exit' or 'ctrl+d' (end of input)
